For the blog feature supastarter integrates [content-collections](https://content-collections.dev/), a markdown based CMS. You can also use a custom datasource for your blog posts by following [the steps below](#use-cms-or-external-datasource-for-blog-posts).

<Callout title="Why content-collections">
  It is a great alternative to headless CMS like Contentful or Prismic based on
  MDX (a more powerful version of markdown). It is free, open source and the
  content is located right in your repository.

## Create a new blog post

To create a new blog post, create a new .mdx file in the `/apps/web/content/posts`. The file name will be the url slug of the post. For example, if you want the url to be https://your-app.com/blog/my-first-post, then the file name should be `my-first-post.mdx`.

The file will start with a frontmatter block, which is a yaml-like block that contains metadata about the post. The frontmatter block should be surrounded by three dashes (---).

```mdx copy
---
title: My awesome blog post
date: 2023-02-28
image: /images/blog/cover.png
authorName: Elon Musk
authorImage: /images/blog/elon-musk.jpg
excerpt: In this post I'm going to tell you about my awesome blog.
tags: [awesome, post]
published: true
---
```

The frontmatter block contains the following fields:

- **title**: The title of the blog post
- **date**: The date of the blog post
- **image**: The cover image of the blog post
- **authorName**: The name of the author of the blog post
- **authorImage**: The url of the image of the author of the blog post
- **excerpt**: A short description of the blog post that will be shown in the blog overview
- **tags**: A list of tags
- **published**: Whether the blog post should be publically listed or not (boolean)

After the frontmatter block, you can write the content of the blog post in MDX:

```mdx copy
# My awesome blog post

In this post I'm going to tell you about my awesome blog.
```

## Use CMS or external datasource for blog posts

You can use the CMS or an external datasource to create your blog posts if you don't want to use MDX to manage your posts.

To do this, all you need to do is to add the data fetching logic that gets the posts from your CMS or datasource in the `apps/web/modules/marketing/blog/utils/lib/posts.ts` file.
Make sure to map the data to the `Post` type.

```typescript
import type { Post } from "@marketing/blog/types";

export async function getAllPosts(): Promise<Post[]> {
	const posts = await fetch("https://your-cms-or-datasource/posts").then((res) => res.json());

	return posts.map((post) => ({
		title: post.title,
    date: post.date,
    authorName: post.author_name,
    tags: post.tags,
    published: post.published,
    locale: "en", // if you don't have a locale, just use your default locale here
    path: post.slug,
    content: post.content, // this is the raw content of the post
    body: post.body, // this is the body of the post which will be rendered in the blog post
    authorImage: post.author_image,
    authorLink: post.author_link,
    excerpt: post.excerpt,
    image: post.image,
	}));
}

export async function getPostBySlug(
	slug: string,
	options?: {
		locale?: string;
	},
): Promise<Post | null> {
	// the same as getAllPosts but for a single post
}
```
