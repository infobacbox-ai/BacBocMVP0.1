Of course you can use every IDE you like, but you will have the best possible developer experience with this starter kit when using VSCode with the suggested extensions.

Once you cloned the project and opened it in VSCode you should be promted to install suggested extensions which are defined in the `.vscode/extensions.json` automatically.
In case you rather want to install them manually you can do so at any time later.

These are the extension we recommend:

## Biome

Biome is a powerful tool that helps you to format and lint your code. It combines the functionality of Prettier and ESLint in a much more performant way.

## i18n-ally

Enables you to translate your app easily within your editor and gives you previews of the translated strings within your component files.

## Tailwind CSS Intellisense

Adds intelligent tooling for writing your styles with Tailwind CSS.

The starter kit also comes with some workspace settings for VSCode that make the development flow more seamless. If you want to change then you can do so in the `.vscode/settings.json` file.
