With streaming responses being very common in times of AI, this guide will cover how to stream responses from your API.

```typescript
export const streamChatResponse = publicProcedure
	.input(
		z.object({
			message: z.string(),
		}),
	)
	.handler(async ({ input }) => {
		const { message } = input;

		const response = streamText({
			model: 'gpt-4o',
			messages: [
				{
					role: 'user',
					content: message,
				},
			],
		});

		return streamToEventIterator(response.toUIMessageStream());
	});
```
