supastarter uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for formatting and linting.

## Auto-format and fix code on save

Per default, Biome is configured to format and lint the codebase while you are developing.

If you want to disable this behavior, open the `.vscode/settings.json` file and set the following options: 

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": false,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "quickfix.biome": "never",
    "source.organizeImports.biome": "never"
  }
}
```

## Manual formatting and linting

To manually format your codebase run:

```bash copy
pnpm format
```

To manually lint your codebase run:

```bash copy
pnpm lint
```

To fix all the linting errors in your codebase run:

```bash copy
pnpm lint --fix
```
