description: Learn how to use PostHog with supastarter.
---

To use PostHog with supastarter, first [create a PostHog account](https://posthog.com) and get your project key.

Then, add the API key to your `.env.local` file and your deployment environment:

```bash copy
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=your_key_here
```

Next, we need to install the PostHog packages:

```bash copy
pnpm add --filter web posthog-js
```

Finally, we need activate PostHog as the analytics provider. To do this, open `apps/web/modules/analytics/index.tsx` and change the content to:

```typescript copy
export * from "./provider/posthog";
```

To customize the PostHog configuration, edit the `apps/web/modules/analytics/provider/posthog/index.tsx`.

**Note for EU users:** You need to adjust the host url:

```typescript copy
posthog.init(posthogKey, {
    api_host: "https://eu.i.posthog.com",
    // ...
});
```

Learn more about analytics with PostHog in the [official documentation](https://posthog.com/docs).
