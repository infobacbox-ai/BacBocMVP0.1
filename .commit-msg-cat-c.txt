fix(deps): add tslib dependency for AWS SDK compatibility

The AWS SDK v3 packages have a peer dependency on tslib, but it wasn't
explicitly declared in the project. During Next.js production builds,
the image-proxy route (which uses @aws-sdk/client-s3) failed with
"Cannot find module 'tslib'" error.

This is a pnpm workspace resolution issue where tslib needs to be available
at the root level for proper module resolution during the Next.js build
process.

Added tslib@^2.8.1 as:
- Root dependency (for pnpm hoisting and build-time resolution)
- apps/web dependency (direct consumer of AWS SDK)
- packages/storage dependency (AWS SDK package location)

This ensures tslib is available wherever AWS SDK is imported.

Affected files:
- package.json (root)
- apps/web/package.json
- packages/storage/package.json
- pnpm-lock.yaml

Root cause: AWS SDK v3 peer dependency on tslib not satisfied in pnpm workspace
Fix: Explicit tslib dependency at multiple levels for proper resolution
Impact: None - runtime behavior unchanged, build now succeeds
