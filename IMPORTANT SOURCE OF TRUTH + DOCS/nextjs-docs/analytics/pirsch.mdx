description: Learn how to use Pirsch Analytics with supastarter.
---

To use Mixpanel with supastarter, first [create a Pirsch account](https://pirsch.io/) and get your app code.

Then, add the app code to your `.env.local` file and your deployment environment:

```bash copy
NEXT_PUBLIC_PIRSCH_CODE=your_code_here
```

Next, we need to activate Pirsch as the analytics provider. To do this, open `apps/web/modules/analytics/index.tsx` and change the content to:

```typescript copy
export * from "./provider/pirsch";
```

To customize the Pirsch configuration, edit the `apps/web/modules/analytics/provider/pirsch/index.tsx`.

Learn more about analytics with Pirsch in the [official documentation](https://docs.pirsch.io/).

For further instructions, follow the [general analytics instructions](/docs/nextjs/analytics/overview).
