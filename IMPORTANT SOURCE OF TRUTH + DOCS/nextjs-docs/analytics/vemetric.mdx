description: Learn how to use Vemetric Analytics with supastarter.
---

To use Vemetric with supastarter, you need to have your application deployed on [Vemetric](https://vemetric.com).

To activate the Vemetric Analytics feature, we need to install the package first:

```bash copy
pnpm add --filter web @vemetric/react
```

Then we need to activate Vemetric as the analytics provider in your supastarter app. To do this, open `apps/web/modules/analytics/index.tsx` and change the content to:

```typescript copy
export * from "./provider/vemetric";
```

Lastly, get the public token from the Vemetric settings page and add it to your environment variables.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_VEMETRIC_TOKEN=your-public-token
```

To customize the Vemetric configuration, edit the `apps/web/modules/analytics/provider/vemetric/index.tsx`.

Learn more about analytics with Vemetric in the [official documentation](https://vemetric.com/docs/product-analytics/getting-started).

For further instructions, follow the [general analytics instructions](/docs/nextjs/analytics/overview).
