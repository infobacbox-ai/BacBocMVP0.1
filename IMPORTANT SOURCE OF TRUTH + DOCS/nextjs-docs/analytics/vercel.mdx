description: Learn how to use Vercel Analytics with supastarter.
---

To use Vercel with supastarter, you need to have your application deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

To activate the Vercel Analytics feature, we need to install the package first:

```bash copy
pnpm add --filter web @vercel/analytics
```

Then we need to activate Vercel as the analytics provider in your supastarter app. To do this, open `apps/web/modules/analytics/index.tsx` and change the content to:

```typescript copy
export * from "./provider/vercel";
```

To customize the Vercel configuration, edit the `apps/web/modules/analytics/provider/vercel/index.tsx`.

Learn more about analytics with Vercel in the [official documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/quickstart).

For further instructions, follow the [general analytics instructions](/docs/nextjs/analytics/overview).
