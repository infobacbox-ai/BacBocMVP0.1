supastarter is the perfect starting point for building your AI-powered SaaS. 
It integrates the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction), which allows you to easily connect to all major AI providers like LangChain, OpenAI, Hugging Face and more.

It also includes a fully working AI chatbot example with a chat history and a context window.

To change the used AI models, simply change the values in the the `/packages/ai/index.ts`:

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

export const textModel = openai("gpt-4o-mini");
export const imageModel = openai("dall-e-3");
export const audioModel = openai("whisper-1");
```

For example, if you want to use Anthropic instead of OpenAI, you can change the `textModel` variable to:

```typescript
import { anthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic";

export const textModel = anthropic("claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620");
```

Then when using any of the AI SDK functions, you can pass the model to it:

```typescript
import { streamText, textModel } from "@repo/ai";

const response = streamText({
  model: textModel,
  messages: [
    { role: "user", content: "What is the capital of France?" }
  ]
});
```
