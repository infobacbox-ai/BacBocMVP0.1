## Prisma

To update your database schema, you can simply edit the `schema.prisma` file in the `/packages/database` library. You can find more information about the Prisma schema file [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema).

To add an entity for "posts" for example, you can add the following to your schema:

```prisma copy
model Post {
  id        String      @id @default(cuid())
  title     String
  content   String
  author    User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

### Migrate changes (optional)

If you want to to keep a migration history of your database changes, you can run the following command to create a new migration:

```bash copy
pnpm --filter database migrate
```

### Push your changes to the database

To push your changes to the database, you can run the following command:

```bash copy
pnpm --filter database push
```

### Generate prisma client

After you have pushed your schema changes, you need to re-generate the prisma client. You can do this by running the following command:

*This command will automatically be run when you start the development server.*

```bash copy
pnpm --filter database generate
```

## Drizzle

To update your database schema, you can simply edit the `packages/database/drizzle/schema/[postgres|mysql|sqlite].ts` file.
You can find more information about the Drizzle schema file [in the official documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/sql-schema-declaration).

### Migrate changes (optional)

To migrate your changes, you can run the following command:

```bash copy
pnpm --filter database migrate
```

### Push your changes to the database

To push your changes to the database, you can run the following command:

```bash copy
pnpm --filter database push
```
