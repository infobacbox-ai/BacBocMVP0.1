## My environment variables from .env.local are not being loaded

Make sure you are running the `pnpm dev` command from the root directory of your project (where the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file is located)

<Callout>
  supastarter uses the dotenv-cli to load environment variables from a
  `.env.local` file. The dotenv-cli is automatically used when running the `pnpm
  dev` command from the root directory.
</Callout>

Also make sure that the environment variable you are trying to access in your application is listed in the `globalEnv` object in the `turbo.json` file. Only then will turbo make the environment variable available to the runtime.

```json title="turbo.json"
{
  "globalEnv": {
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL": "https://your-supabase-url.supabase.co"
  }
}
```

## How do I use the debugger in VSCode with supastarter?

To use the debugger in VSCode with supastarter, you need to add a new configuration to your `.vscode/launch.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Server DEBUG",
      "runtimeExecutable": "pnpm",
      "runtimeArgs": ["run", "dev"],
      "restart": true,
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/apps/web",
      "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env.local"
    }
  ]
}
```

## The changes in the tailwind theme configuration are not being applied

There is a known issue with Tailwind CSS in monorepos which requires you to restart the development server after changing the theme configuration.
If this does not work, try also saving the `globals.css` file in the `web` package and do a hard refresh in the browser.

## My application is very slow in production

The most common reason for a slow application in production is the physical distance between the server or serverless functions and the database.

Make sure to deploy your application to a region that is close to your database.
For example when you are using Supabase and Vercel, you can select the region of the Supabase instance in the setup process and the region of the Vercel serverless functions can be selected in the project settings under the `Functions` tab.

## I'm getting a SSL routines

If you are deploying your app to platforms like DigitalOcean or fly.io, you might get a SSL error like `ERR_SSL_PACKET_LENGTH_TOO_LONG`or `ERR_SSL_WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER`.

This is because of the use of `req.nextUrl.origin` in the `middleware.ts` file, which is not working as expected on these platforms.

The simple fix is to replace **all occurrences** of `req.nextUrl.origin` with `getBaseUrl()` in the `middleware.ts` and the `middleware-helpers.ts` file:

```typescript title="apps/web/middleware.ts"
import { getBaseUrl } from "@repo/utils"; // [!code ++]

export default function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  const { pathname, origin } = req.nextUrl;
  const baseUrl = getBaseUrl();

  if (req.nextUrl.pathname === "/") {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/", origin)); // [!code --]
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/", baseUrl)); // [!code ++]
  }
}

```

```typescript title="middleware-helpers.ts"
import { getBaseUrl } from "@repo/utils"; // [!code ++]

export const getSession = async (req: NextRequest): Promise<Session | null> => {
	const response = await fetch(
		new URL(
			"/api/auth/get-session?disableCookieCache=true",
			req.nextUrl.origin, // [!code --]
			getBaseUrl(), // [!code ++]
		),
	);

	// ...
};
```
