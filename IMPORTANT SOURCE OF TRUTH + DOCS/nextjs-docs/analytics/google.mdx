To use Google Analytics with supastarter, first [create a Google Analytics account](https://analytics.google.com/) and grab your analytics id.

Then, add the app code to your `.env.local` file and your deployment environment:

```bash copy
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=your_id_here
```

Next, we need to activate Google Analytics as the analytics provider. To do this, open `apps/web/modules/analytics/index.tsx` and change the content to:

```typescript copy
export * from "./provider/google";
```

To customize the Google Analytics configuration, edit the `apps/web/modules/analytics/provider/google/index.tsx`.

For further instructions, follow the [general analytics instructions](/docs/nextjs/analytics/overview).
