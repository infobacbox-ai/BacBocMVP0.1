fix: add BETTER_AUTH_SECRET to CI workflow

Better Auth requires the BETTER_AUTH_SECRET environment variable
during initialization. Without it, the build fails with:
"You are using the default secret. Please set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET..."

Added BETTER_AUTH_SECRET to all build-related jobs with a dummy
fallback value for CI purposes. No actual authentication happens
during build - only module initialization needs to be satisfied.
