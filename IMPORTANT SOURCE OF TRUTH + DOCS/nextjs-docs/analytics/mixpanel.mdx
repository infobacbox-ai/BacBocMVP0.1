---

To use Mixpanel with supastarter, first [create a Mixpanel account](https://mixpanel.com) and get your app token.

Then, add the app token to your `.env.local` file and your deployment environment:

```bash copy
NEXT_PUBLIC_MIXPANEL_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

Next, we need to install the Mixpanel packages:

```bash copy
pnpm add --filter web mixpanel-browser
pnpm add --filter web -D @types/mixpanel-node
```

Finally, we need activate Mixpanel as the analytics provider. To do this, open `apps/web/modules/analytics/index.tsx` and change the content to:

```typescript copy
export * from "./provider/mixpanel";
```

To customize the Mixpanel configuration, edit the `apps/web/modules/analytics/provider/mixpanel/index.tsx`.

Learn more about analytics with Mixpanel in the [official documentation](https://docs.mixpanel.com/).

For further instructions, follow the [general analytics instructions](/docs/nextjs/analytics/overview).
