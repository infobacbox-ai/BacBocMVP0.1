description: Learn how to use Plausible Analytics with supastarter.
---

To use Mixpanel with supastarter, first [create a Plausible account](https://plausible.io/) and get plausible app url.

Then, add the app code to your `.env.local` file and your deployment environment:

```bash copy
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAUSIBLE_URL=your_url_here
```

Next, we need to activate Plausible as the analytics provider. To do this, open `apps/web/modules/analytics/index.tsx` and change the content to:

```typescript copy
export * from "./provider/plausible";
```

To customize the Plausible configuration, edit the `apps/web/modules/analytics/provider/plausible/index.tsx`.

Learn more about analytics with Plausible in the [official documentation](https://plausible.io/docs).

For further instructions, follow the [general analytics instructions](/docs/nextjs/analytics/overview).
