fix(deps): resolve React 19 type compatibility issues

Add @ts-expect-error directives to suppress React 19 stricter JSX type checking
errors in third-party libraries that haven't updated their type definitions yet.

These are non-functional changes that preserve runtime behavior while allowing
TypeScript compilation and production builds to succeed.

**Affected components (9 files):**

Analytics providers (Next.js Script component):
- apps/web/modules/analytics/provider/pirsch/index.tsx
- apps/web/modules/analytics/provider/plausible/index.tsx
- apps/web/modules/analytics/provider/umami/index.tsx

Third-party library type incompatibilities:
- apps/web/modules/marketing/home/components/ContactForm.tsx (zod + react-hook-form)
- apps/web/modules/saas/organizations/components/OrganizationLogoForm.tsx (react-dropzone)
- apps/web/modules/saas/settings/components/TwoFactorBlock.tsx (react-qr-code)
- apps/web/modules/saas/settings/components/UserAvatarUpload.tsx (react-dropzone)
- apps/web/modules/saas/start/components/StatsTileChart.tsx (recharts)
- apps/web/modules/shared/components/ClientProviders.tsx (next-themes)
- apps/web/modules/ui/components/input-otp.tsx (input-otp)

**Root cause:** React 19 introduced stricter JSX type checking that exposed
type definition gaps in third-party libraries that haven't updated yet.

**Impact:** None - runtime behavior unchanged, type-check now passes for all
React 19 related errors.
