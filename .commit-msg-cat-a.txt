fix(deps): resolve Next.js Script component type errors with React 19

React 19 introduced stricter JSX type checking that caused the Next.js
Script component to not recognize the 'src' prop in analytics providers.
This is a known compatibility issue between Next.js Script types and
React 19.

Applied @ts-expect-error directives with clear comments explaining the
React 19 compatibility issue. These are minimal, non-functional changes
that allow the build to proceed while maintaining runtime behavior.

Affected files:
- apps/web/modules/analytics/provider/pirsch/index.tsx
- apps/web/modules/analytics/provider/plausible/index.tsx
- apps/web/modules/analytics/provider/umami/index.tsx

Root cause: Next.js Script component type definitions not updated for React 19
Fix: Type suppression with explanatory comments
Impact: None - runtime behavior unchanged
