fix(deps): resolve third-party library type incompatibilities with React 19

React 19's stricter JSX type checking caused type errors with several
third-party libraries that haven't yet updated their type definitions:
- react-dropzone: useDropzone hook and getInputProps() types
- react-qr-code: QRCode component class-based types
- recharts: XAxis, Tooltip, Area component types
- next-themes: ThemeProvider children prop
- input-otp: OTPInputContext slots property
- @hookform/resolvers: zodResolver with Zod schemas

Applied minimal @ts-expect-error directives with clear comments explaining
the React 19 compatibility issues. Also added explicit type annotation for
OtpForm onChange handler to resolve implicit any error.

These are non-functional changes that preserve runtime behavior while
allowing TypeScript compilation to succeed.

Affected files:
- apps/web/modules/marketing/home/components/ContactForm.tsx
- apps/web/modules/saas/auth/components/OtpForm.tsx
- apps/web/modules/saas/organizations/components/OrganizationLogoForm.tsx
- apps/web/modules/saas/settings/components/TwoFactorBlock.tsx
- apps/web/modules/saas/settings/components/UserAvatarUpload.tsx
- apps/web/modules/saas/start/components/StatsTileChart.tsx
- apps/web/modules/shared/components/ClientProviders.tsx
- apps/web/modules/ui/components/input-otp.tsx

Root cause: Third-party libraries not yet fully compatible with React 19 types
Fix: Type suppressions with explanatory comments + explicit type annotation
Impact: None - runtime behavior unchanged
