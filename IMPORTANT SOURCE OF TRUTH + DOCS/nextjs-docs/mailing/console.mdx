For development purposes, you can use the console provider to simply log the emails to the console, you don't need to set any real provider to get started.

Just export the `console` provider in the `/packages/mail/src/provider/index.ts`:

```typescript copy
export * from './console';
```

For further instructions, follow the [general mail instructions](/docs/nextjs/mailing/overview).
