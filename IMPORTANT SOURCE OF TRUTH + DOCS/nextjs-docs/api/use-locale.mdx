Sometimes you need to use the users locale in your API endpoints. For example, you might want to fetch data from a database that is localized or if you want to send an email in the users locale.

The locale of the user (or if no locale is set, the default locale of the application) is available in the context of your endpoint handler.

```tsx copy
export const sayHello = protectedProcedure.handler(async ({ input, context: { locale } }) => {
    return {
        message: `Hello, in ${locale}!`,
    };
});
```
