To use postmark with supastarter, first [create a postmark account](https://postmark.com/) and grab your `server token`.

Add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file and your deployment environment:

```bash title=".env.local" copy
POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN="your-server-token"
```

Then, make sure to activate Postmark in the `/packages/mail/src/provider/index.ts`:

```typescript copy
export * from './postmark';
```

To customize the provider, edit the `packages/mail/src/provider/postmark/index.ts`.

For further instructions, follow the [general mail instructions](/docs/nextjs/mailing/overview).
