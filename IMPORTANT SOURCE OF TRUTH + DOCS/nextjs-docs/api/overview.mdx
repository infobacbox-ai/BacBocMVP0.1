description: Learn how to use the API layer of your supastarter application.
---

supastarter is designed to be a scalable and production-ready fullstack starter kit. One of the core features is a dedicated and extendable API layer.
To enable this in a type-safe manner, we chose [Hono](https://hono.dev/) as the server framework, in combination with [oRPC](https://orpc.unnoq.com/) to call the API from the frontend and [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) to query the API.


<Callout title="Why Hono">
  Hono is a modern and minimalistic web framework for TypeScript and JavaScript. It is designed to be simple, fast and easy to use.
  It is also designed to be very flexible and easy to extend. You can deploy it almost anywhere and use it in a type-safe manner with the Hono RPC client.
  It is also capable of generating an OpenAPI documenation automatically for you API.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Why oRPC">
  oRPC is a library that helps you to call backend functions from the frontend in a type-safe way. It's similar to tRPC,
  but is based on the OpenAPI standard and gives you a few more advanced capabilities.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Why combine Hono and oRPC">
  Hono is a great server framework, but it's RPC client is not as powerful and doesn't offer the same developer experience as oRPC.
  Combining the two gives you a very powerful and flexible API layer with a great developer experience for both RPC and OpenAPI.
</Callout>

All API logic is defined in the `/packages/api/` package.
