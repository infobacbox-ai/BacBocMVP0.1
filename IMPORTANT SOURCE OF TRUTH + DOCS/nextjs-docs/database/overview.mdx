With supastarter you can choose between Prisma and Drizzle as your database ORM.

You can find the schema and configuration in the `packages/database` directory either in the `prisma` or `drizzle` folder.

#### Configure the ORM

##### Prisma

You can skip this if you are using Prisma with PostgreSQL, as this is the default setup.

If you are using a different database than PostgreSQL, you will need to configure the database provider in the `/packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma` file.

```ts copy title="packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma"
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql" // or "mongodb"
}
```

You will also need to change the database provider in the `/packages/auth/auth.ts` file:

```ts copy title="packages/auth/auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
	database: prismaAdapter(db, {
		provider: "mysql", // or "mongodb"
	}),
});
```

In case you are using MySQL, you will also need to remove all occurrences of `mode: "insensitive"` from the project. This is a feature that Prisma does not support for MySQL, so it will cause errors on build.
Simply search in the project for `mode: "insensitive"` and remove it.

##### Drizzle

If you want to use Drizzle instead of Prisma, you will need to change the export in the `/packages/database/index.ts` file:

```ts copy title="packages/database/index.ts"
export * from "./drizzle";
```

Next make sure to use the drizzle adapter in the `/packages/auth/auth.ts` file:

```ts copy title="packages/auth/auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
	database: drizzleAdapter(db, {
		provider: "mysql", // or "sqlite" or "pg"
	}),
});
```

If you are using a different database than PostgreSQL, you will need to export the schema for either `mysql` or `sqlite` from the `/packages/database/drizzle/schemaindex].ts` file.

```ts copy title="packages/database/drizzle/schema/index.ts"
export * from "./postgres";
// or export * from "./mysql";
// or export * from "./sqlite";
```

Lastly, you will need to set up the correct database client in the `client.ts` file. Follow the instructions in the [Drizzle documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started-postgresql) for the database provider you are using. For PostgreSQL you can use the following example:

```ts copy title="packages/database/drizzle/client.ts"
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/node-postgres";
import * as schema from "./schema/postgres";

const databaseUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL as string;

if (!databaseUrl) {
	throw new Error("DATABASE_URL is not set");
}

export const db = drizzle(databaseUrl, {
	schema,
});
```
