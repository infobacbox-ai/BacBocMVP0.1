## Get the API key

After you have created your account for [Dodo Payments](https://dodopayments.com/), you will need to get the API key. You can do this by going to the [API keys page](https://app.dodopayments.com/developer/api-keys) in the dashboard. 

## Add environment variables

To use the Dodo Payments integration, you need to define the following environment variables to your `.env.local` as well as your production environment:

```bash title=".env.local" copy
DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY="" # Your Dodo Payments API key
DODO_PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_SECRET="" # The secret key of the webhook you created (see below)
```

## Create products

For your users to choose from the available subscription plans, you need to create those _Products_ first on the [Products page](https://app.dodopayments.com/products). You can create as many products as you want, but you will need to create at least one product for the integration to work.

Create one product per plan you want to offer. You can add multiple prices within this product to offer multiple currencies or different billing intervals.

## Create a webhook

To sync the current subscription status and other information to your database, you need to set up a webhook.

The webhook code comes ready to use with supastarter, you just have to create the webhook in the Dodo Payments dashboard and insert the URL for your project.

To configure a new webhook, go to the [Webhooks page](https://app.dodopayments.com/developer/webhooks) in the Dodo Payments settings and click the _Add endpoint_ button.

Select the following events:

- `checkout.session.completed`
- `subscription.created`
- `subscription.updated`
- `subscription.cancelled`

To get the URL for the webhook, you can either use a local development URL or the URL of your deployed app:

### Local development

If you want to test the webhook locally, you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a tunnel to your local machine. Ngrok will then give you a URL that you can use to test the webhook locally.

To do so, install ngrok and run it with the following command (while your supastarter development server is running):

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

This will give you a URL (see the _Forwarding_ output) that you can use to create a webhook in Dodo Payments. Just use that url and add `/api/webhooks/payments` to it.

### Production / preview deployment

When you have already deployed a version of your project, you can use the actual URL to create the webhook with. This will be necessary for a production version your app later anyway.

**Make sure you have a deployed version that has the `DODO_PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable set.**

Then you can use the URL of your deployed app and add `/api/webhooks/payments` to it.

Example URL: `https://your-app.com/api/webhooks/payments`

## Set up products in app

The created products have to be defined in the `config/index.ts` file:

```js title="config/index.ts"
export const config = {
  payments: {
		plans: {
			free: {
				isFree: true,
			},
			pro: {
				recommended: true,
				prices: [
					{
						type: "recurring",
						productId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DODO_PRODUCT_ID_PRO_MONTHLY as string,
						interval: "month",
						amount: 29,
						currency: "USD",
						seatBased: true,
						trialPeriodDays: 7,
					},
					{
						type: "recurring",
						productId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DODO_PRODUCT_ID_PRO_YEARLY as string,
						interval: "year",
						amount: 290,
						currency: "USD",
						seatBased: true,
						trialPeriodDays: 7,
					},
				],
			},
		},
	},
};
```

We are using envs for the product ids, so you can define different product ids for each environment, as you probably want to use the test mode for development.

Define the product ids in your `.env.local` and in the environment variables of your production environment:

```bash title=".env.local" copy
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_ID_PRO_MONTHLY=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCT_ID_PRO_YEARLY=""
```

Learn more about the payment plans configuration in [_Manage plans and products_ documentation](/docs/nextjs/payments/plans).

## Set currency for locales in your app

Lastly you need to configure the currency that should be used for each locale in your app.

You can this by setting the `currency` property for each locale in the config file.

```js title="config/index.ts"
export const config = {
  i18n: {
    // ...
    locales: {
      en: {
        currency: "USD",
        language: "en",
      },
      de: {
        currency: "EUR",
        language: "de",
      },
    },
  },
  // ...
};
```

## Test Mode vs Live Mode

Dodo Payments provides two environments for testing and production:

- **Test Mode**: Use `https://test.dodopayments.com` for development and testing
- **Live Mode**: Use `https://live.dodopayments.com` for production

Make sure to use the appropriate environment URLs and API keys for each stage of your development process.

Per default, supastarter uses **Live mode** when the NODE_ENV is set to `production`. You can change this behavior in the `packages/payments/providers/dodopayments/index.ts` file.
