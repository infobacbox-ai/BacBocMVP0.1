This guide will show you how to deploy your supastarter application with [Coolify](https://coolify.io) to your own server.

### Setup Coolify

Before you can deploy your supastarter application with Coolify, you need to have a server and a Coolify account.

Follow the [Coolify setup guide](https://coolify.io/docs/quickstart) to get started.

### Deploy your supastarter application

#### Create a new project 

First create a new project in Coolify.

#### Add a new resource

Select the `Production` environment and click `Add a new resource`.

Choose `Private Repository (with Github App)`:

#### Connect your Github repository (with Github App)

If you haven't already created a Github App that connects your Coolify instance to your Github repository, you will be asked to create one.

Follow the instructions to create a Github App and connect it to your Coolify instance.

#### Create a new application

After you have connected your Github repository, you can create a new application by selecting the Github App connection you just created and then selecting the repository you want to deploy:

Make sure to select the branch you want to deploy, like `main`. 

#### Configure the application

You will be redirected to the application configuration page. Here you need to configure the build settings for your application.

Set the following values:

- **Install Command**: `pnpm install`
- **Build Command**: `corepack enable; pnpm install --frozen-lockfile; pnpm build`
- **Start Directory**: `pnpm --filter web start`

#### Add environment variables

Before we we deploy the application, we need to add the environment variables in the `Environment Variables` tab.

Add all the envs from the `.env.local` file in your project root and make sure to use the production environment variables here.

#### Deploy the application

Now you can click the `Deploy` button to deploy your application. This will start the build process and deploy your application to your server.

After the build process is finished, your application will be deployed to your server.

You probably want to assign a custom domain to your application. You can do this by setting it in the `Domain` field on the configuration page.

Lastly, set the defined domain as the `NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` environment variable in the `Environment Variables` tab and redeploy the application by clicking the `Redeploy` button in the top right corner.

Now you have a fully working supastarter application deployed to your own server.
