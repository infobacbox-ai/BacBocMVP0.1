As the package manager we chose [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

<Callout title="Why pnpm">
  It is a fast, disk space efficient package manager that uses hard links and
  symlinks to save one version of a module only ever once on a disk. It also has
  a great [monorepo support](https://pnpm.io/workspaces).

## Install a package

To install a package to the supastarter monorepo you need to decide whether you want to install it to the root of the monorepo or to a specific workspace. Installing it to the root makes it available to all packages, while installing it to a specific workspace makes it available only to that workspace.

To install a package globally, run:

```bash
pnpm add -w <package-name>
```

To install a package to a specific workspace, run:

```bash
pnpm add --filter <workspace-name> <package-name>
```

Here is a list of the workspaces of supastarter:

- web
- api
- auth
- database
- mail
- eslint-config-custom
- tsconfig
- tailwind
- utils

## Remove a package

Removing a package is the same as installing but with the `remove` command.

To remove a package globally, run:

```bash
pnpm remove -w <package-name>
```

To remove a package to a specific workspace, run:

```bash
pnpm remove --filter <workspace-name> <package-name>
```

## Update a package

Updating is a bit easier since there is a nice way to update a package in all workspaces at once:

```bash
pnpm update -r <package-name>
```
