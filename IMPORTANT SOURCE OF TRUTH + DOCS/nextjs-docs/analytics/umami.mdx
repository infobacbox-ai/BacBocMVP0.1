description: Learn how to use Umami Analytics with supastarter.
---

To use Umami with supastarter, first [create a Umami account](https://umami.is/) and get your tracking id.

Then, add the tracking id to your `.env.local` file and your deployment environment:

```bash copy
NEXT_PUBLIC_UMAMI_TRACKING_ID=your_id_here
```

Next, we need to activate Umami as the analytics provider. To do this, open `apps/web/modules/analytics/index.tsx` and change the content to:

```typescript copy
export * from "./provider/umami";
```

To customize the Umami configuration, edit the `apps/web/modules/analytics/provider/umami/index.tsx`.

Learn more about analytics with Umami in the [official documentation](https://umami.is/docs).

For further instructions, follow the [general analytics instructions](/docs/nextjs/analytics/overview).
